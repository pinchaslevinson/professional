    <h1>Street Signage: Road Safety and More</h1>
   Despite the ever-easier cloud-based tools available to drivers navigating American cities, street signage continues to provide valuable safety information to drivers and other road users. This method of warning and informing drivers also helps to manage road and driver costs by regulating the traffic flow among four- and two-wheeled vehicles, pedestrians, and others who travel the streets. In both design and usage, traffic signs play multiple roles. We set out below to explain how this evolving roadside aid maintains its relevance and importance for the motorized travel experience safety and cost.
<h3>Street Signage Context</h3>
Signs are part of a variety of elements of the built environment that planners and drivers encounter regularly. As part of the overall visual character, they are tasked with disparate safety purposes, As per the US Department of Transportation Office of Highway Safety, street signage guidance includes:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Regulatory:</strong> Control/Command/Prohibition/Reservation</li>
 	<li><strong>Warning:</strong> Road Layout/Direction of Movement</li>
 	<li><strong>Guidance:</strong> Location/Route Markers/Direction</li>
 	<li><strong>Temporary:</strong> Command/Prohibition</li>
</ul>
The challenge has always been to render a graphically consistent and increasingly efficient and optimized network from these disparate challenges and purposes. Optimally, signs dispense information as needed with their effectiveness enhanced or degraded by: visibility (conspicuity), legibility and readability (recognition). Safety dangers abound with non-optimized and fully maintained street signage. Road signs should share key features:
<ul>
 	<li>Consistency</li>
 	<li>Understandability</li>
 	<li>Contextuality—Warning about non-obvious hazards</li>
 	<li>Safety oriented for drivers, pedestrians and cyclists</li>
 	<li>Promotion of traffic movement and route completion for veteran and new drivers</li>
</ul>
<h3>Future Direction</h3>
Making roads safer is an ongoing project with new technologies providing the direction and means of cost control. Previously, traffic signs were required to be in compliance with a minimum retroreflectivity, with <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtte.2016.03.009">strong association shown between damage and retroreflectivity</a>.  Different types of LEDS and solar power are examples of technological advancement directly impacting street signage and safety (minimizing retrofelectivity importance).
